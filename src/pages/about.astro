					Writing didn't start as a career for me — it started as a habit.
				</p>

				<p>
					A notebook. A restless mind. And a need to make sense of ideas that felt bigger than words.
				</p>

				<p>
					Everything changed the day someone told me, "You have a way of putting feelings into words." That moment stayed with me. Since then, writing has been more than content or captions — it has been a bridge between people, ideas, and meaning.
				</p>

				<p>
					Today, I help individuals and businesses turn complex concepts into content that feels human, clear, and authentic. My goal is simple: help your message land, resonate, and earn trust.
